            April 2025</p></div> <div class="text"><p>Canadians voted, and were left with the greatest consolidation in the two major parties since 1958. In a historic turnaround, the Liberals led by Mark Carney find themselves forming government for the fourth time in a row. The Liberals won <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #DC4633;">43.7%</span> of the national vote, <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #DC4633;">up by 11.1%</span> from the last election, for <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #DC4633;">169 seats</span>. As recently as January, they were polling dangerously close to a wipeout - until former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned, and threats to sovereignty by the United States came to dominate the national political conversation.</p> <p>They were tailed closely by 
            the Conservatives who won <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #1E3765">41.3%</span>, <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #1E3765">up by 7.6%</span>, for <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #1E3765">143 seats</span>. 
            Led by Pierre Poilievre, they capitalized on a <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/2025-federal-election-final-poll-of-campaign/" target="">desire for change</a>, especially winning over voters upset about the cost-of-living crisis, with notable inroads into <a href="https://thelocal.to/young-conservative-right-wing-voters-poilievre-carney/" target="">young voters</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-so-many-second-generation-south-asian-and-chinese-canadians-planning-to-vote-conservative-253820" target="">visible minorities</a>. <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #EBA00F"></span></p> <p>The left-leaning New Democrats netted just <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #EBA00F">6.3%</span>, <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #EBA00F">down by 11.5%</span> from the last election, for <span style="border-bottom: solid 4px #EBA00F">7 seats</span>. This was their worst performance in the party's history. Despite winning progress on national dental care and pharmacare programs from the governing Liberals, some voters flocked away from the party to rally around the Liberals in the wake of threats to sovereignty, while the Conservatives made <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cpc-ndp-working-class-votes-canada-1.7166294" target="">deliberate</a> <a href="https://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2025/04/ekos-predicts-liberal-majority/" target="">inroads</a> into its historical working-class base.</p> <p>These were the national trends, but how did all of this play out in Canada cities and suburbs? Below we visualize changes in vote share and total seats in Canada's three largest metros (Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal), and compare between the central cities and the suburbs for each of these regions.</p></div> <div class="container" style="max-width: 850px;"><div class="panel-grid svelte-1qcca2t"><!--[!--><!--]--></div></div> <div class="text"><p>The Conservatives saw clear gains in the suburbs of the Greater Toronto Area - flipping seats in Brampton and Markham. Home to large numbers of South Asian and East Asian Canadians respectively, this is consistent with work affiliated to the School of Cities showing <a href="https://schoolofcities.github.io/gta-immigration/political-shifts" target="">immigrants</a> and <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/sociology/utsc-sociologist-breaks-down-surge-south-asian-and-chinese-canadian-support-conservatives" target="">minorities</a> are shifting to the right. The Conservatives also saw large gains in Vancouver's suburbs, accompanied by an NDP collapse - but failed to make a breakthrough.</p> <p>ADD BIT ABOUT CHANGES IN MONTREAL? (only toronto and van noted above)</p> <p>We now turn our attention to other major cities in Canada.</p> <p>Both major parties saw decisive games at the expense of other smaller parties in many cities - but generally, gained less votes in the cities compared to the rest of the country. In Edmonton and Calgary, historically Conservative-voting cities, the Liberals failed to mount a breakthrough, even though their vote share increased.</p> <p>Ottawa and Quebec City were the only two cities where Conservatives lost vote share agains large Liberal gains. MORE ABOUT THIS?</p></div> <div class="container" style="max-width: 1275px;"><div class="panel-grid svelte-1qcca2t"><!--[!--><!--]--></div></div> <br> <br> <div class="footnotes"><h3>Data &amp; Methods</h3> <p>We obtained geographic boundaries for cities and metro regions from the <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21" target="_blank">2021 Canadian census</a>, using Census Subdivisions (CSDs) for cities and Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) for regions. Two exceptions were made: for Toronto, we used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_the_Greater_Toronto_Area" target="_blank">Greater Toronto Area</a> instead of the Toronto CMA because it is more widely recognized, and for Montreal, we used the full island due to its complex municipal borders. We selected 9 cities based on population size and geographic diversity, along with the three most populous metro regions.</p> <p>The <a href="https://osdp-psdo.canada.ca/dp/en/search/metadata/NRCAN-FGP-1-2bf02698-f0aa-4758-a538-a01be833d439" target="_blank">riding boundaries</a> for the 2025 election followed the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution. A riding was assigned to a city or metro region if at least 50% of its geographic area fell within that jurisdiction. Ridings within a metro region but outside its core city – such as one in Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area – were classified as suburban.</p> <p>Vote data for the 2021 election came from Elections Canada’s <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rep/tra/2023rep&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e" target="_blank">transposed results</a>, while 2025 results were sourced from <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2025/results/" target="_blank">the CBC</a> (also derived from Elections Canada). As of writing, 99% of all results were reporting. We aggregated votes and seat counts for each region by summing the results of its constituent ridings. Vote shares were displayed only for larger parties (the Green Party and People's Party did not register significant results in any region), and seat counts were shown only if a party won at least one seat in either 2021 or 2025.</p> <p>You can find the data <a href="https://github.com/schoolofcities/canada-election-2025/tree/main/static/data/results" target="_blank">here</a>, and all the code in the <a href="https://github.com/schoolofcities/canada-election-2025" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p></div> <div class="text"><svg width="100%" height="10" viewBox="0 0 100 20" preserveAspectRatio="none"><!--[--><rect x="0" width="33.1" y="10" height="10" fill="#DC4633"></rect><rect x="33.1" width="34.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#1E3765"></rect><rect x="67.4" width="16" y="10" height="10" fill="#EBA00F"></rect><rect x="83.4" width="7.6" y="10" height="10" fill="#6FC7EA"></rect><rect x="91" width="2.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#00A189"></rect><rect x="93.3" width="4.9" y="10" height="10" fill="#6D247A"></rect><rect x="98.2" width="1.8" y="10" height="10" fill="#D3D3D3"></rect><!--]--></svg><!----> <svg width="100%" height="10" viewBox="0 0 100 20" preserveAspectRatio="none"><!--[--><rect x="0" width="43.7" y="10" height="10" fill="#DC4633"></rect><rect x="43.7" width="41.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#1E3765"></rect><rect x="85" width="6.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#EBA00F"></rect><rect x="91.3" width="6.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#6FC7EA"></rect><rect x="97.6" width="1.3" y="10" height="10" fill="#00A189"></rect><rect x="98.89999999999999" width="0.5" y="10" height="10" fill="#6D247A"></rect><rect x="99.39999999999999" width="0.6" y="10" height="10" fill="#D3D3D3"></rect><!--]--></svg><!----></div> <br> <br></main><!----><!----><!----><!--]--><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
